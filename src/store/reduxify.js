 * Reduxifies a container.
 *
 * @param selector   - The name of the desired substate, or a function describing
 *                     the selection logic. The selector selects what part of the
 *                     state is given to the container.
 * @param actionSets - An array of actionSets or an object of actionSets.
 *                     If the actionSets are contained in an array, the resulting
 *                     injected prop is a single aggregation of all the actions.
 *                     If the actionSets are contained in an object, multiple props
 *                     are injected, each corresponding to each actionSet.
 * @param actionSet  - A single actionSet object. The actionSet will be injected as
 *                     the 'actions' prop.
 * @param container  - The container to be connected.
 * @return           - If the container was specified, the connected container.
 *                     Otherwise, the enhancer function.
