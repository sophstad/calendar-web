## General

Please make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned. Likewise, please check for issues related to update, as someone else may be working on the issue in a branch or fork.

* Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first
* Develop in a topic branch, not master
* Squash your commits

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ADI-Labs/calendar-web/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

## Development

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/calendar-web.git

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message should include a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
 <type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Lines should not exceed 100 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools and produces a nice, neat commit log ie:

```

  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

#### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `webpack`,
`helpers`, `api` etc...

#### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* Use the imperative, present tense: **"change"** (not "changed", not "changes")
* Capitalize first letter

* Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.
