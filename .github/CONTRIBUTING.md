# Contributing
We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community.  By contributing to Calendar, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/ADI-Labs/calendar-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions
Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ADI-Labs/calendar-web/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

If you are a member of *Aesthetic*, create a card here on the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/ADI-Labs/calendar-web)

## Development

Visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ADI-Labs/calendar-web/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.

Fork, then clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calendar-web.git
```

### Aesthetic Members

If you are part of the *Aesthetic* team, the following instructions give you a streamlined development process.

*Make a new branch*. Name your branch the name of your new intended feature, prefixed with your initials and a slash.
```bash
$ git checkout -b js/my-new-feature
```

Make your changes. `commit` frequently. `git add`'s `-patch` option is encouraged (interactive add). Commit messages should be in the imperative present tense.
```bash
$ git add --patch
...
$ git add ./stuff/morestuff/my-untracked-file
...
$ git commit -m "Implement my new WORKING sub-feature-1"
...
$ git commit -m "Implement my new WORKING sub-feature-2"
```


When finished, push to a NEW branch on github.
```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin js/my-new-feature
```

Make a pull request, tag someone in a comment or poke someone on slack for review. Merge and delete branch when done.

>Don't forget to switch back to the master branch on your local machine and delete the old feature-branch when you're finished:
```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git branch --delete js/my-new-feature
```




### Building

#### Build Calendar

Running the `build` task will create both a CommonJS module-per-module build and a UMD build.
```bash
npm run build
```

To build for production, run `build:prod`.
```bash
npm run build:prod
```


### Testing and Linting
To run both linting and testing at once, run the following:
```bash
npm run tests
```

To only run tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

To continuously watch and run tests, run the following:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

To perform linting with `eslint`, run the following:
```bash
npm run lint
```


### Style
The Aesthetic team represents style in all dimensions. Beauty in design, beauty in structure, beauty in precision, beauty in execution. We follow the [standard](http://standardjs.com) form.

## Submitting Changes
* Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/ADI-Labs/calendar-web/issues).
* Fork the repo.
* Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch.
* Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
* Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

Thank you for contributing.
